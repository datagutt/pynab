# Pynab Rust Rewrite Documentation

This directory contains the complete specification and implementation plan for rewriting the core Pynab services in Rust. This documentation serves as the definitive guide for implementing a high-performance, memory-safe version of the Nabaztag daemon and core services.

## Documentation Overview

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plans
- **[Rust Implementation Plan](rust-implementation.md)** - Complete roadmap for Rust rewrite with architecture, dependencies, and implementation phases
- **[Migration Strategy](migration-strategy.md)** - Step-by-step migration from Python to Rust with rollback procedures

### ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications  
- **[Protocol Specification](protocol-spec.md)** - Complete nabd protocol definition with packet types and communication patterns
- **[Hardware Interface Spec](hardware-spec.md)** - Hardware abstraction requirements and interface definitions
- **[Service Architecture Spec](service-architecture.md)** - Service framework patterns and base implementations

### ðŸ“š Reference Documentation
- **[Packet Reference](packet-reference.md)** - Detailed specification of all protocol packet types with validation rules
- **[State Machine Spec](state-machine.md)** - Complete state machine specification with transitions and behaviors
- **[Hardware Models](hardware-models.md)** - Supported hardware configurations and capabilities

## Implementation Goals

### Performance Targets
- **Memory Usage**: 50% reduction from Python baseline
- **Response Time**: <1ms protocol packet processing
- **Audio Latency**: <50ms command-to-audio delay
- **Stability**: Zero crashes over 30-day operation

### Compatibility Requirements
- **Protocol**: 100% compatibility with existing Python services
- **Hardware**: Support all existing hardware models (2018-2022)
- **Configuration**: Read existing database configurations
- **Resources**: Use existing audio files and choreographies

### Quality Standards
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time protocol validation
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error types and handling
- **Testing**: >90% test coverage with integration tests
- **Documentation**: Complete API and behavior documentation

## Quick Start for Implementers

1. **Read the Implementation Plan**: Start with [rust-implementation.md](rust-implementation.md) for the complete architecture and roadmap

2. **Understand the Protocol**: Review [protocol-spec.md](protocol-spec.md) for the communication patterns between services

3. **Study the Hardware Interface**: Check [hardware-spec.md](hardware-spec.md) for hardware abstraction requirements

4. **Review Reference Materials**: Use the packet and state machine references for detailed specifications

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Protocol & Infrastructure
- Packet type definitions and serialization
- Hardware abstraction trait definitions  
- Basic service framework
- Virtual hardware for testing

### Phase 2: Core Daemon (nabd)
- TCP server implementation
- State machine with proper transitions
- Service connection management
- Command queue and execution

### Phase 3: Hardware Interfaces
- LED control with WS2812B support
- Ear motor control via GPIO
- Button handling with event detection
- Audio system with ALSA integration

### Phase 4: Core Services
- nabboot: System startup and hardware configuration
- nabclockd: Time management and sleep scheduling
- nabtaichid: Random choreography service

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- Complete protocol compatibility validation
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Migration tooling and procedures
- Documentation finalization

## Architecture Principles

### Memory Safety
- Zero-copy packet processing where possible
- Explicit memory management for hardware resources
- Safe concurrency with Rust's ownership model
- No unsafe code except for hardware interfaces

### Performance
- Async-first design with tokio runtime
- Efficient JSON processing with zero-copy where possible
- Hardware resource pooling and reuse
- Real-time scheduling for audio/choreography timing

### Reliability
- Explicit error handling with typed errors
- Graceful degradation on hardware failures
- Automatic recovery from service disconnections
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Maintainability
- Clear separation between protocol, business logic, and hardware
- Trait-based architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive test suite with mocking support
- Self-documenting code with extensive type annotations

## Success Metrics

The Rust implementation will be considered successful when:

- [ ] All packet types serialize/deserialize identically to Python
- [ ] Hardware operations match Python timing and behavior exactly
- [ ] Memory usage is reduced by at least 50%
- [ ] Audio latency is under 50ms consistently
- [ ] System runs for 30 days without crashes
- [ ] All existing Python services work unchanged with Rust nabd
- [ ] Migration can be completed without system downtime

## Contributing Guidelines

When implementing components based on this specification:

1. **Follow the Architecture**: Implement exactly as specified in the architecture documents
2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure 100% protocol compatibility with existing Python services
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and hardware simulation tests
4. **Document Changes**: Update specifications if implementation reveals design issues
5. **Performance First**: Optimize for the performance targets specified in each component

## Validation Process

Each component should be validated against:

1. **Functional Tests**: Does it work identically to the Python version?
2. **Performance Tests**: Does it meet the specified performance targets?
3. **Compatibility Tests**: Does it work with existing Python services?
4. **Integration Tests**: Does it integrate properly with other Rust components?
5. **Hardware Tests**: Does it work correctly on target Raspberry Pi hardware?

This documentation provides everything needed to implement a complete, high-performance Rust version of the core Pynab services while maintaining full compatibility with the existing ecosystem.
